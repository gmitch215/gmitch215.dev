I illustrate my passion for video games, computers,
and software as a whole through the development, modification,
and release of various platforms and projects that engage my users
in a fun and proactvice way. My favorite color is lime green.

My first programming experience started in late 2018 when I began working with Drupal and PHP on various websites inside brightplum. And, my first solo industry-grade experience began in 2019 when I developed my first discord bot for servers that I privately managed. Falling in love with programming, and having experience in various block editors like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), it foreshadowed a long, prosperous, and active path of software development for me at the age of 11. I did some more JavaScript stuff with my first node module, [nodebook](https://nodebook.js.org), before working on Minecraft plugins and modifications during my middle school and early high school years.

[Terminal Miner](https://github.com/gmitch215/Terminal-Miner), the first game I ever made in C++, is when I started branching out into all different kinds of programming languages.

I work in all kinds of programming and video game design, such as with [Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com), [KorGE](https://korge.org), and many more. This began with my first video game company, [Calculus Games](https://calcugames.xyz).

I've developed many different kinds of things, which began from my creating of discord bots into the development of Minecraft plugins. Slowly, I became immersed within a rich developer culture, and continue to consume feedback at a high standard to ensure quality products. However, in this waking age of Artificial Intelligence, human skill and knowledge emphasize the need for creativity in the tech space. This influenced me to develop [The Earth App](https://earth-app.com), a contradictory social media platform that encourages you to go outside.
